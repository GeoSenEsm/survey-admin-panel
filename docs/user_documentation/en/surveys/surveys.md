## Preview

In the task details, there is a tab called `Preview`. This tab allows you to manage the survey's state, edit it, and view it.

#### Survey States

A survey can be in one of two states:
- Created
- Published

If the survey is published, it can no longer be edited or deleted. You can manage the survey's state using the buttons:
